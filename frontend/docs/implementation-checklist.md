# SolidJS Frontend Implementation Checklist

> **Instructions for AI implementers:**
> 
> 1. Use this checklist to track progress through the implementation.
> 2. For each commit, add detailed implementation notes in the "Implementation Notes" section, documenting:
>    - Key decisions made during implementation
>    - Any deviations from the original plan and why
>    - Challenges encountered and their solutions
>    - Potential optimizations or improvements for the future
> 3. As you complete each step, mark it as completed in the checklist using [x].
> 4. If you discover that future steps need adjustment based on your implementation, update those checklist items with more specific details.
> 5. Review and refine future steps in the checklist before starting them.
> 6. Each commit should be focused, self-contained, and include appropriate tests.
